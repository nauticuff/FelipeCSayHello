Mini Challenge #1 - Say Hello
I wrote some code that prints out a prompt.
It then saves the user's input as a variable.
It then prints out another response plus the user's name.

Peer review by : Kenneth Fujimura
Program works as intended. The data validation all works. I thought a few of your responses were humorous. All of your console outputs are very clean and organized. The only things I would recommend:
- Indent everything inside your overall while loop, the way you indented everything inside the if statements. It's not a big deal here in this program, but it helps people reading your program keep track of what is and isn't inside your while loops.
- Your repository is named "felipecSayHello" and I would just capitalize the 'f' and 'c' so it's "FelipeCSayHello" just to be safe. I'm 80% sure that Mr Martinez will want us to very strictly follow the guidelines including making sure we've capitalized the name part of our program titles.
Everything else looks good! Great job, Carlos.
